    <h1>Privacy Policy for NickiFy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 10, 2026</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how NickiFy ("we", "our", or "us") handles
      your information when you use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong
        >NickiFy does not collect, store, or transmit any personal
        information.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
      <li>We do not store the text you enter into the app</li>
      <li>All text transformations happen locally on your device</li>
      <li>We do not track your app usage or behavior</li>
      <li>We do not collect device identifiers or location data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How the App Works</h2>
    <p>NickiFy is a simple text transformation tool that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes text input from you</li>
      <li>Transforms it into stylized Unicode characters</li>
      <li>Displays the results for you to copy</li>
      <li>All processing happens entirely on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The app does not store any data persistently. When you enter text, it is
      only temporarily held in your device's memory while being processed and is
      not saved anywhere.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      NickiFy does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics
      platforms, or advertising networks. We do not share any information with
      third parties because we don't collect any information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our app is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13, as we
      do not collect any personal information from anyone.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since we don't collect or store any data, there are no data security
      concerns related to personal information storage or transmission.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page with an updated effective date.
    </p>
